-- CONTROLS rebinding: a captured key must not reach the live map while the
-- screen that captured it is still steering by that map (#510).  Swapping A
-- and B used to close the screen mid-swap, because Input:applyBindings ran
-- inside BindingsMenu:storeBinding and turned the player's next confirm
-- press into a cancel.  A capture commits on the RELEASE of its press, a
-- second held input cancels it, and a captured input that another row owns
-- swaps rather than steals (#589).  No pokered cite: rebinding is
-- port-only (gap C2).
