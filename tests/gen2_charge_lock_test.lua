-- Found by the Gold route bot (tests/drivers/gold_bot.lua), which lost to
-- ELITE FOUR BRUNO seventeen times running at levels 62 through 85 and could
-- not have won at any level:
--
--   ELITE FOUR BRUNO sent out HITMONLEE!
--   HITMONLEE used DIG!
--   HITMONLEE flew up high!
--   TYPHLOSION used STRENGTH!
--   TYPHLOSION's attack missed!
--   HITMONLEE used HI JUMP KICK!
--   TYPHLOSION used STRENGTH!
--   TYPHLOSION's attack missed!          <- forever

-- On the cart the charge sets SUBSTATUS_CHARGED and CheckEnemyTurn reuses
-- wEnemySelectedMove, so the second turn IS the stored move. The port asked the
-- AI again. That skips the stored attack, and because `vanished` is only
-- cleared by the branch in Battle:useMove that recognises the second half, the
-- mon stays semi-invulnerable for the rest of the battle -- untouchable by
-- anything, while still attacking every turn.
--
-- DIG and FLY are one effect in Gen 2 (EFFECT_FLY), which is also why DIG
-- announced itself with Fly's line; BattleCommand_Fly picks the text off the
-- move (`cp DIG`), not the effect.
